      <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        This website was created as a part of the Introduction to Cognitive Science course, aimed at showcasing the powerful relationship between cognitive science and biotechnology. We believe that understanding the human mind not only advances psychology and neuroscience, but also leads to medical and technological breakthroughs that change lives.

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        We are students of biotechnology exploring interdisciplinary applications of our field. With guidance from our instructor, we have explored how the principles of cognitive science—such as perception, decision-making, language, and learning—interact with biological technologies to solve real-world challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to bridge science and technology with human values to support better healthcare, smarter interfaces, and a more insightful understanding of the brain.

      <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Explore the core concepts of cognitive science and how they connect to biotechnology.</li>
        <li>Analyze real-life applications such as BCIs, neuroprosthetics, and AI-driven diagnostics.</li>
        <li>Understand ethical implications of cognitive technology use in medicine.</li>
        <li>Encourage interdisciplinary thinking in young scientists and students.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        The ability to decode how our brain works, and use that information to treat neurological diseases, enhance human abilities, and create intelligent interfaces, defines the future of both biotechnology and medicine. This project is our small step in understanding that future.
